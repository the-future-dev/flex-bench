\section{DOM-Bench Task Suite Details}
\label{app:task_suite} % Label for referencing

This appendix provides a brainstorming of tasks within the DOM-Bench suite.
TODO: in depth decision of Sim Environments and Real Environments.
- GarmentLab: pros comprehensive for garments cons: almost only garments.
- DaXBench: pros: covers 1D, 2D and 3D objects cons: sim-to-real gap, no embodiments.

\subsection{Fundamentals}
\label{app:task_suite_1}

Tier 1 focuses on evaluating core shape control and manipulation primitives, serving as the foundation for more complex interactions. Tasks are easily accessible in simulation 
environments such as SoftGym and DaXBench, allowing for controlled testing.
% Evaluation centers on basic manipulation success metrics, shape accuracy measurements, and efficiency of execution.

\subsection{Complex Interactions}
\label{app:task_suite_2}

\subsection{Foundation Model Evaluation}
\label{app:task_suite_3}

Tier 3 specifically evaluates capabilities unique to foundation models, including language understanding, reasoning, planning, generalization, and adaptation. These tasks are primarily conducted in real-world settings at the RPL Lab to fill the missing literature of tasks within DOM simulators ad hoc for foundational models.
% Evaluation measures instruction following fidelity, planning success across extended sequences, generalization capabilities to novel scenarios, and resolution of ambiguous instructions.
