\section{DOM-Bench Task Suite Details}
\label{app:task_suite} % Label for referencing

This appendix provides specific examples of tasks within the DOM-Bench suite, categorized by tier. Each task contributes to evaluating the capabilities outlined in Section 2.2 (Benchmark Design).

\subsection{Fundamentals}

Tier 1 focuses on evaluating core shape control and manipulation primitives, serving as the foundation for more complex interactions. Tasks are primarily conducted in simulation environments such as SoftGym and DaXBench, allowing for consistent and controlled testing. Evaluation centers on basic manipulation success metrics, shape accuracy measurements, and efficiency of execution.

\subsection{Complex Interactions}

Tier 2 advances to multi-step sequences, tool use, constrained motion, and basic object interactions, representing intermediate complexity in deformable object manipulation. These tasks are evaluated in both simulation (Garment Lab) and real-world settings (RPL Lab) to assess transferability. Evaluation emphasizes overall task completion, planning capabilities, interaction quality, and adherence to physical constraints.

\subsection{Foundation Model Evaluation}

Tier 3 specifically evaluates capabilities unique to foundation models, including language understanding, reasoning, planning, generalization, and adaptation. These tasks are primarily conducted in real-world settings at the RPL Lab to test true embodied intelligence. Evaluation measures instruction following fidelity, planning success across extended sequences, generalization capabilities to novel scenarios, and resolution of ambiguous instructions.
